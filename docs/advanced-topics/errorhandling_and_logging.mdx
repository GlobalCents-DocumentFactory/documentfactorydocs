# Logging in DocumentFactory

DocumentFactory produces log output that is written to daily log files located in the \logs subdirectory of the directory
specified by the NATS_SERVER_ROOTFS property in the DocumentFactory configuration
([**.env**](../configuration/df_configuration). file).

## Log Location

```log
{NATS_SERVER_ROOTFS}\logs\
```

A separate log file is created for each day. The file is named using the following format:

```log
documentfactory-all-YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

## Log Entry Format

Each log entry includes the following fields, separated by |:

```log
<timestamp>|<eventId>|<level>|<logger>|<message>
```

Fields:

- **timestamp** — full timestamp with milliseconds (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.ffff)
- **eventId** — optional identifier of the event (defaults to 0 if not specified)
- **level** — log level, e.g. DEBUG, INFO, ERROR
- **logger** — the source component or class
- **message** — the log message; may include error details

```log
2025-07-07 10:43:40.5506|0|DEBUG|PTFDEngine.NATSProcessor|Creating bucket jkepo58qh7aqu053ctgg6
2025-07-07 10:43:40.5506|0|INFO|PTFDEngine.TasksHandler|Updating task zaqr82osjadexcu16mbxa status to Errored - Document processor not found for doctype unknown
2025-07-07 10:43:40.6299|0|ERROR|PTFDEngine.WorkflowHandler|Document processor not found for doctype unknown
```

## Log Usage

Log files are useful for:

- Tracking document processing status
- Debugging workflows and pipelines
- Error diagnosis and support
- Operational monitoring

## Additional Notes
- Logging is configured automatically and does not require manual setup.
- Log rotation is daily, but retention management (e.g. archiving or deletion) must be handled manually.
