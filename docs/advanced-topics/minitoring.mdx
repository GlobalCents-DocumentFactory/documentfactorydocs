# Monitoring with Prometheus

DocumentFactory exposes metrics in a format compatible with [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/), enabling integration with modern monitoring
and alerting systems.

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects metrics
from configured targets at given intervals, stores them efficiently, and allows powerful queries using the PromQL language.
Prometheus is widely used for observing application performance, resource usage, and system behavior in real time.

## Setting Up Prometheus to Monitor DocumentFactory

To collect and view DocumentFactory metrics, install Prometheus and configure it to scrape the metrics endpoint exposed
by the application.

**Basic steps:**

- **Install Prometheus** on your infrastructure. (Instructions and downloads are available in the official
    [**Prometheus documentation**](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/).)
- **Add a scrape job** for DocumentFactory in your `prometheus.yml` configuration file, pointing to the /metrics endpoint (on port 5123).
- **Restart Prometheus** to apply the new configuration.

## DocumentFactory Metrics

The DocumentFactory exposes internal metrics via the Prometheus-compatible HTTP endpoint:

```txt
http://<host>:5123/metrics
```
:::note
On Windows, you may need to grant explicit permissions for the HTTP listener if running as a non-administrator or as a service user.
This is accomplished using the netsh command:

```powershell
netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:5123/metrics user=YOUR-DOMAIN\YourUser
```

### Service Info Metrics

Exposes static information about the application, including the .NET version, application name, and version.

| Metric Name       | Type  | Labels                                      | Description                                                  |

| Metric Name             | Type    | Labels         | Description                                        |
|-------------------------|---------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `ptfd_workflow_counter` | Counter | `workflow_type`| Counts total number of workflow executions.        |
| `ptfd_workflow_errors`  | Counter | `workflow_type`| Counts number of workflows that resulted in error. |
| `ptfd_workflow_latency` | Summary | `workflow_type`| Measures workflow execution latency (in ms).       |

#### Label Definitions:

- `workflow_type` – Type of workflow (`Standard` is currently the only value used).

### Artifact Metrics

Metrics related to artifact creation or processing.

| Metric Name              | Type    | Labels                             | Description                                          |
|--------------------------|---------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `ptfd_artifact_counter`  | Counter | `artifact_type`, `artifact_action` | Counts total number of artifact operations.          |
| `ptfd_artifact_errors`   | Counter | `artifact_type`, `artifact_action` | Counts number of artifact-related errors.            |
| `ptfd_artifact_latency`  | Summary | `artifact_type`, `artifact_action` | Measures artifact processing latency (in ms).        |

#### Label Definitions

- `artifact_type` – Type of storage used for the artifact (e.g., `nuts`, `s3`, `fs`).
- `artifact_action` – Type of operation performed: `upload` or `download`.

### Job Metrics

Metrics related to job execution, categorized by job and processor types.

| Metric Name           | Type    | Labels                         | Description                                     |
|-----------------------|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `ptfd_job_counter`    | Counter | `job_type`, `job_processortype`| Counts total number of job executions.          |
| `ptfd_job_errors`     | Counter | `job_type`, `job_processortype`| Counts number of jobs that resulted in an error.|
| `ptfd_job_latency`    | Summary | `job_type`, `job_processortype`| Measures job execution latency (in ms).         |

#### Label Definitions

- `job_type` – Processing stage of the job, e.g., `Preprocess`, `Postprocess`, `Merge`.
- `job_processortype` – Name of the processor handling the document, e.g., `pdf`, `word`, `image`.


### Document Processor Metrics

Metrics related to document processing operations.

| Metric Name                    | Type    | Labels                                 | Description                                           |

## Using Grafana to Visualize Metrics

Grafana is an open-source analytics and dashboard platform that provides powerful visualization capabilities for DocumentFactory metrics.

**To view and analyze metrics:**

- Install Grafana by following the official [**Grafana documentation**](https://grafana.com/get/).
- Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
- Create dashboards to display key DocumentFactory metrics as charts, tables, and indicators.

Grafana dashboards can be used to monitor system health, workflow performance, error rates, and latency, utilizing
visualization options such as time series graphs, gauges, and tables.


**Basic workflow for dashboard creation:**

- In the Grafana interface, **select “+” → “Dashboard”** and add panels with the necessary metrics.
- For each panel, specify Prometheus as the data source and enter the appropriate PromQL queries for the metrics to be displayed.
- Panels can be arranged and customized to meet specific monitoring needs.

A ready-to-use dashboard JSON file, containing sample panels for DocumentFactory metrics, is available:

<a href={useBaseUrl('/files/grafana-dashboard.json')} download>
    Download Grafana dashboard JSON
</a>

This file can be imported in Grafana via **“Dashboards” → “Import”**.

Below is a screenshot illustrating the example dashboard:

<DocImage
    src="monitoring/grafana_dashboard.png"
    alt="DF config location"
    maxWidth="800px"/>

Dashboards and panels can be further edited to provide a more convenient or unique view, depending on project or team requirements.

For more details on customization and advanced configuration, refer to the [**Grafana documentation**](https://grafana.com/docs/).
