# MinIO

As an alternative to Nats, MinIO can be used as an object storage server within DocumentFactory.

MinIO is an S3-compatible storage system that integrates with DocumentFactory to store processing data reliably.

## When to Use MinIO

MinIO is particularly suitable in scenarios such as:
- Handling large document payloads or datasets
- Ensuring persistent and durable storage beyond the scope of message queues
- Meeting compliance and archival requirements
- Integrating with S3-compatible infrastructure or cloud platforms

By using MinIO, DocumentFactory can separate document storage from message processing, which may improve resilience
and scalability in certain deployment models.

## Installing MinIO

MinIO is open-source and supports multiple platforms. Download the appropriate installer for your system from
the official [**MinIO**](https://min.io/open-source/download) website and follow the installation instructions.

For detailed information about MinIO, please refer to the [**official documentation**]( https://min.io/docs ).

If using the standalone MinIO binary, it can be placed in the DocumentFactory **Installation Location**, as specified
during the [**installation process**](../getting-started/setup#installation-overview).

To enable automatic startup of the MinIO service by DocumentFactory, the following setting should be configured in the
[**.env**](../configuration/df_configuration) file:

```env title=".env"
S3_SERVER_START=false
```
When this setting is enabled, DocumentFactory will start the MinIO service automatically. In this case, the **Data Directory**
selected during the "Select the Data Directory" step of the [**installation process**](../getting-started/setup#installation-overview)
will serve as the container for the data directory used by MinIO.

## MinIO Access Keys

After installing MinIO, a web-based management interface — MinIO Console — becomes available. By default, it can be accessed via:
```console
http://localhost:9001
```

Use the root credentials that were set during installation (usually MINIO_ROOT_USER and MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD) to log in.

Once logged in:
1. Navigate to the **"Access Keys"** section.

2. Create a new access key by specifying:

    - Access Key — a unique identifier.

    - Secret Key — a secure password for the key.

3. Save the credentials securely. These keys are used by clients to authenticate and interact with the object storage.

In DocumentFactory and its client applications, if MinIO is selected as the object storage backend, the generated access and secret keys must
be specified in the configuration file (dfclient.env) using the following parameters:

```console
MINIO_ACCESSKEY=<your-access-key>
MINIO_SECRETKEY=<your-secret-key>
```
