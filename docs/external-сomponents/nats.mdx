# NATS

NATS is a high-performance, lightweight, and open-source messaging system that DocumentFactory uses for
inter-process communication, coordination, and message persistence. It acts as the backbone for message-based
communication between the client applications and the core DocumentFactory services.

## Role in DocumentFactory

By default, NATS is used as the primary message store and transport layer. It enables real-time communication and
event-driven workflows across multiple clients and services. This includes:

- Document submission from client applications to the processing pipeline.
- Status monitoring and event tracking.
- Queuing and buffering messages for processing.
- Distributing workloads across multiple processing nodes.

## Installation and Runtime

NATS is installed automatically with DocumentFactory and does not require separate setup. The nats-server executable
is extracted into the directory specified during the **Select the Installation Location** step of the DocumentFactory
[**installation process**](../getting-started/setup#installation-overview).

The NATS server is launched automatically when DocumentFactory starts, making the messaging infrastructure immediately available.

For more information about NATS and its capabilities, visit the [**official NATS documentation**](https://nats.io).

## NATS Keys

To securely connect DocumentFactory and client applications with the NATS server, a pair of cryptographic keys must be generated:
a public key and a private key. These keys are used for signing and verifying communication between clients and the NATS server.

### Key Generation

During the installation of DocumentFactory, the *nk* executable—a command-line utility provided by the NATS ecosystem—is
unpacked into the Installation Location specified in the **Select the Installation Location** step of the setup process.

To generate a new pair of NATS keys, open a terminal in the installation directory and run the following command:

```console
nk -gen user -pubout
```

This will generate two keys:

- A public key (e.g., UAXXXXXXXX)
- A private key (e.g., SAXXXXXXXX)

### Usage in dfclient.env
The generated keys should be added to the dfclient.env configuration file as follows:

```env title="dfclient.env"
NATS_PUBLICKEY=UAXXXXXXXX
NATS_PRIVATEKEY=SAXXXXXXXX
```

:::note
Replace the above values with the actual keys

### Registering the Key in the NATS Server Config
To authorize the client, the public key must also be registered in the NATS server config.

This step ensures that the server recognizes and accepts incoming connections signed with the corresponding private key.

The NATS server configuration file is typically named `nats.conf` and is located in the same directory as the
nats-server executable — that is, in the Installation Location specified during the DocumentFactory setup.

Add the generated public key to the list of authorized keys. For example:

```hcl title="nats.conf"
authorization: {
   users: [
    { nkey: UAXXXXXXXX }
   ]
}
```
After saving the configuration file, restart the NATS server for the changes to take effect.
