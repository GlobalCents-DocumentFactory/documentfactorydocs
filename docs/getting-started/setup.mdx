## Visual Studio Code configuration

Utilizing Visual Studio Code, we will generate a JSON file to configure the DocumentFactory pipeline.
Edit the Visual Studio Code settings file located in :
```shell
C:\Users\<You>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json
```
Open the file and add the following section:

```shell
"json.schemas": [
    {
        "fileMatch": [
          "/pipeline.json"
        ],
        "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnocera/ptfd8-jsonschema/main/model.json"
    }
]
```

This will provide auto-completion for editing the DocumentFactory pipeline file in Visual Studio Code.
