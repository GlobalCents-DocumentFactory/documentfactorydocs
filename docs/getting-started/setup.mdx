# Installation & Requirements

## Supported Environments

GCI DocumentFactory is designed to be platform-independent and can be deployed in the following environments:

- Windows (Azure)
- Linux (various distributions, tested on Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL)
- Kubernetes (for containerized, cloud-native deployments)

DocumentFactory supports both on-premise and cloud deployments. Choose the environment that aligns with your
organization’s infrastructure and scaling needs.

## Downloading the Installer

To get started, visit the official GCI website and log in using your credentials. Once you're signed in, locate
**DocumentFactory** in the list of available applications or use the search function to find it quickly.
Be sure to download the installer that matches your environment—for example, **Windows**, **Linux**, or **Kubernetes**.
Save the installer to your computer to begin the installation process.

## Installation Overview
This section provides installation instructions for each supported environment. Depending on your platform, follow the relevant guide below:

### Windows Installation
Once you've launched the installer, follow the steps in the installation wizard.
Each step includes a configuration option you may want to review before proceeding.

1. **Accept the License Agreement**
Review and accept the terms to proceed with the installation.

3. **Select the Data Directory**
Choose a location where DocumentFactory will store essential runtime data, including necessary resources for the application to function.

4. **Ready to Install**

Once the installation is complete, the application files are unpacked into the directories specified during setup.
Additionally, a Windows service named **GCI DocumentFactory Engine** is created.

This service ensures that the document conversion engine starts automatically and operates continuously in the background,
enabling automated document processing without requiring manual intervention.
