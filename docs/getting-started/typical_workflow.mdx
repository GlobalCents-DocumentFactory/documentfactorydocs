# Typical Workflow

A typical DocumentFactory workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Environment Setup**

[**Install**](./setup) DocumentFactory on your target platform (Windows, Linux, or Kubernetes).
During installation, configure essential parameters via the [**.env**](../configuration/df_configuration) file,
including input/output directories, maximum concurrency settings, and integration details for services like
[**NATS**](../external-сomponents/nats) and [**MinIO**](../external-сomponents/minio).

2. **Define the Processing Pipeline**

Create one or more pipelines (see [**how to build a pipeline**](../category/pipeline-actions)) that define the sequence
of processing steps to apply to incoming documents - see [**pipeline definition**](./terminology_and_concepts#pipeline)
for more details on what a pipeline is.

3. **Trigger Workflows**

Submit documents manually through the [**Web**](../client_tools/web_client) or [**Console Client**](../client_tools/console_client),
or automate ingestion by placing files into the monitored input directory.

4. **Workflow Execution**

The engine executes [**workflows**](./terminology_and_concepts#workflow) by breaking them down into individual
[**tasks**](./terminology_and_concepts#task), which are then processed according to the defined logic.

5. **Store or Deliver Output**

Once processing completes, results are stored in the defined output directory or uploaded to external systems such as
[**MinIO**](../external-сomponents/minio) (used as an S3-compatible object store). Metadata, logs, and status information are retained for monitoring and auditing purposes.
