# Typical Workflow

A typical DocumentFactory workflow includes the following steps:

- **Install and configure the environment**

Deploy DocumentFactory on a supported platform (Windows, Linux, or Kubernetes), and define the input, output, and data directories during setup.

- **Define processing rules**

Set up transformation parameters using input parameters or configuration files with the Console Client, or define them directly via the Web Client.
This includes operations such as conversion to PDF, OCR, compression, and more.

- **Submit documents for processing**

Send documents using the Web Client, Console Client, or by placing them into configured input directories. DocumentFactory picks up files automatically based on your setup.

- **Automated transformation**

The engine processes each file according to the defined rules â€” converting, merging, compressing, applying OCR or watermarks, and saving the result to the output location.

- **Retrieve the output**

Processed documents are saved in the specified output directory or passed along to external systems, depending on the configured workflow.
