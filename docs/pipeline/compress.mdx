# Compress

The Document Factory enables to optimize document workflows by incorporating compression capabilities.
Compression is a crucial feature that helps reduce the file size of documents, making them more efficient for storage,
transfer, and distribution. This can be particularly beneficial when dealing with a large number of documents or
when document storage space and transfer speeds are a concern.

## Properties

### `actioncompress`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean</code>

The `actioncompress` property is a boolean flag used within the `processors` or `postprocess` arrays to control whether
the compression process should be applied to documents. The `actioncompress` property, when set to `true`, enables the
compression of documents within the specified pipeline stage.

Compression can be applied to both PDF documents and image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and TIFF. This makes it especially
useful when working with mixed content workflows that include scanned documents or embedded images.

For PDF documents specifically, additional compression settings can be defined using the
[**`settingspdfcompression`**](./pdfsettings#settingspdfcompression) property inside the [**PDF Settings**](./pdfsettings) object.
These settings allow for fine-grained control over how compression is applied, including parameters like image downsampling and JPEG quality.
They are not applicable to image files directly, but rather influence how image content within PDFs is optimized.

### Example

```json title="pipeline.json"
{
  "processors": [
    {
      "actioncompress": true,
      "settingspdf": {
        "settingspdfcompression": {
          "compress": true,
          "downsample": 150,
          "jpegquality": 50
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
