# Flatten Signatures

The **Flatten Signatures** action is designed to permanently apply all interactive elements of a PDF — including digital
signatures, form fields, and annotations — by converting them into static page content.

After flattening:

- **Signature fields** are fixed into the document and cannot be moved, edited, or removed.

- **Form fields** (text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-downs, etc.) are rendered as plain content, no longer editable.

- **Annotations** (comments, highlights, stamps, notes, links, etc.) are embedded into the page and lose their interactivity.

This ensures document integrity, prevents tampering with fields or annotations, and prepares the file for reliable archiving, viewing, or printing.

This action is supported for the following document types:

- **PDF files** — all signatures, forms, and annotations are flattened into static content.

- (Other formats are not supported.)

## Properties

### `actionflattensignatures`

Type: <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean</code>

The `actionflattensignatures` property is a flag that activates the FlattenSignatures action in the processing pipeline.
When set to `true`, all digital signatures, form fields, and annotations in the PDF will be flattened and made non-editable.

This property can be used within the `processors` or `postprocessors` arrays to instruct the system to apply flattening
as part of the document processing workflow.

## Example

```json title="pipeline.json"
{
  "processors": [
    {
      "actionflattensignatures": true
    }
  ]
}
```
This configuration tells the DocumentFactory to flatten all signatures, forms, and annotations in the PDF during processing.
