# Merge

The merging stage combines multiple documents or input sources into a single logical unit. This is commonly used
to group related files—such as cover pages, attachments, and main content—into one cohesive and structured dataset.
The merge behavior is defined within the pipeline configuration and can be customized to fit specific workflow requirements.

## Properties

## `merge`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean</code>

The `merge` setting enables the document merging feature within the processing pipeline.
By setting this property to `true`, the system will combine multiple input documents into a single output file during execution.
Set this property to `false` if you prefer to process each original document individually, and create a separate output
document for each original document.

:::note
Enabling merging in the pipeline does not automatically convert input documents to a single file format before
they are combined. Merging documents of different types (for example, PDF and Word) may lead to processing errors.
It is recommended to convert all input documents to a common file type (such as PDF) before the merge stage.
This pre-processing step helps prevent compatibility issues and ensures consistent output.
:::

Example:
```json title="pipeline.json"
{
    "processors": [
        {
            "actionconvert": true,
            "settingsconvert": {
                "saveformat": "pdf"
            }
        }
    ],
    "merge": true
}
```

In the example above:

- The `actionconvert` property is enabled, triggering the conversion step in the processing pipeline.
- The `settingsconvert` block specifies that all input documents should be converted to PDF format.
- The `merge` option is set to `true`, instructing the system to combine the converted documents into a single output file.
- This configuration is suitable for handling input files in various formats which will first be converted to PDF before being merged.

By default, when using the **Console Client**, the resulting merged document takes the name of the directory containing
the input documents. If multiple directories are involved, the name of the first directory is used as the output file name.

When using the **Web Client**, the resulting merged document is, by default, named after the first input document
and can be changed during the download process.

### `mergesettings`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>object</code>

Additionally, the `mergesettings` object provides detailed configuration options for the merge process. This is an
extension that allows for more granular control over how the merge is carried out.

The `mergesettings` object may include:

- <Link to="#settingswordmerge">`settingswordmerge`</Link> - configuration of the merging process for Word documents merging only.

#### `settingswordmerge`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>object</code>

The section provides further choices for flexible configuration of the merging process for Word documents merging only:

##### `sectionstart`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>string</code>

Defines where a new section should begin within the document.
The possible values for this property are:
- ***Continuous***: The new section starts immediately after the previous one, without any page breaks.
- ***NewPage***: The new section starts at the top of the next page.
- ***NewColumn***: The new section begins at the top of the next column.

##### `columnset`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>string</code>

Specifies the column layout for the document. The possible values for this property include:
- ***none***: The section will have a single-column layout.
- ***twocols***: Allows for the appending of columns from one page to the columns on the next page.


##### `linebetweencols`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean</code>

Indicates whether a vertical line should be drawn between columns in a multi-column layout.
If set to `true`, a vertical line will appear between columns. Set this property to `false` to disables the line.
