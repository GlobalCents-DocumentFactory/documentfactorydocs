# Merge

The merging stage combines multiple documents or input sources into a single logical unit. This is commonly used
to group related files—such as cover pages, attachments, and main content—into one cohesive and structured dataset.
The merge behavior is defined within the pipeline configuration and can be customized to fit specific workflow requirements.

## Properties

### `merge`

The property determines whether the merge process should be part of the pipeline.
If the `merge` property is set to `true`, it indicates that the input documents will be merged during the execution
of the pipeline. Set this property to `false` if you prefer to process each original document individually,
and create a separate output document for each original document.

:::note
Enabling the merge property in the pipeline does not automatically convert input documents to a single file type before
merging. Merging documents of different types (for example, PDF and Word) may lead to processing errors.
It is recommended to convert all input documents to a common file type (such as PDF) before the merge stage.
This pre-processing step helps prevent compatibility issues and ensures consistent output.

Example:
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="json" label="Pipeline" default>
        ```json title="pipeline.json"
        {
            "processors": [
                {
                    "actionconvert": true,
                    "settingsconvert": {
                    "saveformat": "pdf"
                },
                    "settingspdf": {
                        "pdfformat": "v_1_7"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "merge": true,
            "Pipelinesettings":{
                "Deleteoriginalonsuccess": false
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="input" label="Input">
        ```console title="input directory"
        ├── DocumentSet
            └── Document one.pdf
            └── Document two.docx
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="output" label="Output">
        ```console title="input directory"
        ├── DocumentSet.pdf
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

By default, when using the **Console Client**, the resulting merged document takes the name of the directory containing
the input documents. If multiple directories are involved, the name of the first directory is used as the output file name.

When using the **Web Client**, the resulting merged document is, by default, named after the first input document
and can be changed during the download process.

### `mergesettings`

The `mergesettings` property provides detailed configuration options for the merge process. This is an extension
that allows for more granular control over how the merge is carried out.

The `mergesettings` property is an object that can have the following properties:

- <Link to="#settingswordmerge">`settingswordmerge`</Link> - configuration of the merging process for Word documents merging only.


#### `settingswordmerge`

The section provides further choices for flexible configuration of the merging process for Word documents merging only:


##### `sectionstart`

The `sectionstart` property allows to define where a new section should begin within the document.
The possible values for this property are:
- `Continuous`: The new section starts immediately after the previous one, without any page breaks.
- `NewColumn`: The new section begins at the top of the next column.
- `NewPage`: The new section starts at the top of the next page.
- `EvenPage`: The new section begins on the next even-numbered page. If the current page is even,
    it will start on the next even page; otherwise, it may insert a blank page if necessary.
- `OddPage`: The new section starts on the next odd-numbered page. If the current page is odd,
    it will begin on the following odd page, possibly inserting a blank page if needed.


##### `columnset`

The property allows to define the column layout for the document. The possible values for this property include:
- `none`: The section will have a single-column layout.
- `twocols`: Allows for the appending of columns from one page to the columns on the next page.


##### `linebetweencols`

The property in the pipeline allows to specify whether a vertical line should be drawn between columns in a
multi-column layout. If the `linebetweencols` property is set to `true`, it indicates that a vertical line
will be drawn between the columns. Set this property to `false` if you prefer not to have a line between the columns.


##### `inheritpagesetup`

The property in the pipeline determines whether the new section should inherit
the page setup (including margins, paper size, orientation, etc.) from the previous section.
If the `inheritpagesetup` property is set to `true`, it indicates that the new section will inherit the page
setup from the previous section. Set this property to `false` if you want the new section to have a distinct page setup.

##### `endpagesectionstart`

This property determines where the last page of the output document starts.
The possible values for this property are:
- `Continuous`: The last page appends to the previous page of the document.
- `NewColumn`: The last page starts at the top of the next column.
- `NewPage`: The last page starts at the top of the next page.
- `EvenPage`: The last page starts on the next even-numbered page.
    If the current page is even, it will start on the next even page; otherwise, it may insert a blank page if necessary.
- `OddPage`: The last page starts on the next odd-numbered page.
    If the current page is odd, it will begin on the following odd page, possibly inserting a blank page if needed.

##### `mergetrackchanges`

The property determines whether the track changes (such as insertions, deletions, and format changes if enabled
in the Word document) should be merged and retained in the output document.
If the `mergetrackchanges` property is set to `true`,it indicates that the track changes will be merged and retained
in the output document. Set this property to `false` if you prefer not to include track changes in the merged document.


The property in the pipeline specifies whether track changes should be merged and retained at the character level.
This allows for finer granularity in tracking and merging text changes.
If the `mergetrackchangescharacterlevel` property is set to `true`, it indicates that track changes will be merged and
retained at the character level in the output document. Set this property to `false` if you prefer to handle
track changes at a less granular level.
