# OCR

The **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** feature in DocumentFactory enables the extraction of machine-readable text
from image-based content such as scanned PDFs or photos. This is particularly useful for processing PDF documents
that consist of images only—such as those generated from scanned paper files—and converting them into searchable and indexable outputs.

## Properties

### `actionocr`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean</code>

The `actionocr` setting activates the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) feature within the document processing pipeline.
By setting this property to `true` within the `processors` or `postprocess` arrays, enable the OCR functionality,
which allows the system to recognize and extract text from images or scanned documents.

### `settingsocr`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>object</code>

Additionally, the `settingsocr` object provides configuration parameters for the OCR action.

It may include the following options:

- <Link to="#checknotextonly">`checknotextonly`</Link> - defines whether he Document Factory will skip the OCR process for those
documents that already have the searchable text layer.
- <Link to="#autorotateimages">`autorotateimages`</Link> - defines whether images in the document should be automatically
rotated to correct orientation during the OCR process.
- <Link to="#resolution">`resolution`</Link> - defines the resolution (DPI - Dots Per Inch) to be used for the OCR.
- <Link to="#ocrdevice">`ocrdevice`</Link> - specifies the OCR device to be used for processing.
- <Link to="#downscalefactor">`downscalefactor`</Link> - determines the factor by which the original image is downscaled
before OCR processing.

### `checknotextonly`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean</code>

The `checknotextonly` setting determines whether the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process should be skipped for
documents that already contain a searchable text layer. By setting this property to `true`, the Document Factory will bypass
the OCR process for such documents, thereby optimizing the processing time and efficiency. Conversely, setting this property
to false will ensure that all documents undergo the OCR process, regardless of whether they already contain a searchable
text layer.

This property is useful for enhancing the document processing workflow by avoiding redundant OCR operations on documents
that do not require text recognition, thereby saving resources and time.

### `resolution`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>integer</code>

The `resolution` defines the scanning resolution, in DPI (dots per inch), used during OCR processing.
Higher values provide more detailed images and can improve text recognition accuracy—especially for low-quality scans
or small fonts. However, increasing the resolution may also lead to longer processing times and higher memory usage.

Specify the value as an integer. For example, setting resolution to 300 means the OCR engine will interpret images at 300 DPI.

Recommended values:

- **200 DPI** – minimum acceptable for clear, typed text.
- **300 DPI** – standard value balancing quality and performance (recommended).
- **400–600 DPI** – for high-precision OCR (e.g. degraded scans, small fonts).
- **Over 600 DPI** – rarely necessary; may not yield better results but will slow down processing.

Choosing an appropriate resolution helps balance accuracy and efficiency for your document processing needs.

### `ocrdevice`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>string</code>

Specifies the OCR device used for text recognition during document processing. Different OCR devices offer varying
processing capabilities, such as different color depths or optimized performance for specific document types.
Selecting the appropriate OCR device helps balance output quality, file size, and processing efficiency.

If set to null, the system will use the default OCR device.

Available options include:

- `pdfocr8` — outputs PDF with 8-bit grayscale images.
- `pdfocr24` — outputs PDF with 24-bit color images (RGB).
- `pdfocr32` — outputs PDF with 32-bit color images (CMYK).

### `ocrdevice`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>string</code>

The `ocrdevice` property specifies the OCR device to be used for processing. Different OCR devices may offer varied
capabilities, such as different OCR engines or settings optimized for specific types of documents. By selecting
the appropriate OCR device, you can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of text recognition.

Setting this property to null will use the default OCR device. The available string options for this property include:

Options:
- `pdfocr8`: PDF OCR device with 8-bit processing.
- `pdfocr24`: PDF OCR device with 24-bit processing.
- `pdfocr32`: PDF OCR device with 32-bit processing.

Choosing the right OCR device ensures that the document processing is tailored to the specific requirements of
your documents, leveraging the strengths of each OCR device to achieve optimal results.

### `downscalefactor`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>integer(1-8)</code>

Defines the factor by which the internally rendered image is downscaled before OCR is performed. This helps optimize
performance by reducing the image resolution passed to the OCR engine, especially when the internal rendering resolution
(e.g., 600 DPI) exceeds what is typically necessary for accurate text recognition.

For example, if the internal rendering is done at 600 DPI and `downscalefactor` is set to 3, the image passed to OCR
will be effectively 200 DPI.

Usage recommendations:

- **1**: No downscaling (full resolution is used).
- **2–3**: Common values for balancing speed and accuracy.
- **4–8**: Use with caution; may significantly reduce OCR accuracy.

:::note
Values above 8 are not supported.

## Example

```json title="pipeline.json"
{
    "processors": [
        {
            "actionocr": true,
            "settingsocr": {
                "checknotextonly": true,
                "resolution": 300,
                "ocrdevice": "pdfocr24",
                "downscalefactor": 1
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
In the example above:

- OCR is enabled as part of the processing pipeline using the `actionocr` flag.
- The `checknotextonly` setting tells the system to skip OCR for documents that already include searchable text, which helps
    save time and resources.
- OCR will be performed at a resolution of 300 DPI, providing a solid balance between quality and performance for most scanned documents.
- The selected OCR device is `pdfocr24`, which generates PDFs with 24-bit RGB color depth — a good choice for color documents.
- No downscaling is applied (downscalefactor: 1), meaning the images are processed at full resolution for optimal recognition accuracy.
