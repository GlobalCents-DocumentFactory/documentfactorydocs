# Overview

**Pipeline Actions** define the individual processing steps that are applied to documents within a configured pipeline.
Each action corresponds to a specific task—such as format conversion, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), watermarking,
or file compression—and determines how a document is transformed as it moves through the processing workflow.

Actions are grouped under two main arrays in the pipeline configuration:
- **processors** – the primary actions executed during the main processing phase.
- **postprocessors** – the actions performed after the core processing is complete, typically used for final enhancements
    or output adjustments.

Each action is enabled using a dedicated flag (e.g., `actionocr`) and can be supplemented with a corresponding
configuration object (e.g., `settingsocr`) for more granular control over how the action behaves.

In addition to these actions, the pipeline may also include a `merge` directive, which determines whether multiple input
documents should be combined into a single output file before postprocessing. This allows for advanced document composition
and batch processing scenarios.

Together, these components enable the creation of flexible, automated, and reusable workflows that can handle diverse
document processing requirements with consistency and efficiency.
