# PDF Settings

This section provides configuration options related to PDF processing within the DocumentFactory pipeline.

## `settingspdf`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>object</code>

The `settingspdf` is an auxiliary configuration object used to tailor various PDF generation processes such
as conversion, compression, and more. This property is designed to provide additional settings that enhance and customize
the PDF creation workflow within the Document Factory's document processing pipeline.

The `settingspdf` object can be included within `processors` or `postprocess` arrays to ensure optimal configurations
for distinct PDF-related tasks. Each section where these settings can be applied will include relevant references
and links to the corresponding `settingspdf` properties.

### `settingspdfcompression`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>object</code>

The `settingspdfcompression` is a configuration object nested within the `settingspdf`, providing a set of parameters
specifically for fine-tuning the PDF compression process. This property comes into play
when the [**actioncompress**](./compress.mdx) flag is set to `true`, allowing for detailed control
over how compression is applied to PDFs.

The `settingsmergemeta` property can contain the following properties:

- <Link to="#downsample">`downsample`</Link> - Specifies the resolution to which images should be downsampled.
- <Link to="#jpegquality">`jpegquality`</Link> - Determines the quality of JPEG images.

#### `downsample`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>integer (default = 150)</code>

The `downsample` property specifies the resolution, in dots per inch (DPI), to which images should be downsampled during
the compression process. This integer value sets the image resolution to lower the overall file size of the PDF.
For example, if the PDF contains high-resolution images (e.g. 600 dpi), `downsample`: 150 means that these images will be
downsampled to 150 dpi.

- *Higher DPI (300–600)*: Better for printing, but larger files.
- *Lower DPI (72–150)*: Good enough for on-screen viewing or archiving.

#### `jpegquality`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>integer (default = 100)</code>

The `jpegquality` property sets the quality of JPEG images within the PDF after compression, on a scale from 0 to 100.
This integer value determines the compression quality. Higher values maintain better image quality but result in larger files,
while lower values reduce image quality for smaller file sizes.

- *Higher values (e.g. 80–100)*: better image quality, but larger file size.
- *Lower values (e.g. 40–60)*: significantly smaller file size, but noticeable quality degradation.

### `pdfformat`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>string</code>

The `pdfformat` property is part of the `settingspdf` configuration object. It allows users to specify the desired
PDF format for generated documents, such as during the [**conversion**](./convert.mdx) process,
ensuring the resulting PDF meets specific format requirements.

The value for this property can be one of the following options:

- `PDF_A_1A`: PDF/A-1a format for long-term preservation, with full compliance for accessibility.
- `PDF_A_1B`: PDF/A-1b format for long-term preservation, ensuring basic conformance without full accessibility.
- `PDF_A_2A`: PDF/A-2a format for long-term preservation, based on PDF 1.7, with full accessibility.
- `PDF_A_2B`: PDF/A-2b format ensures visual integrity for long-term preservation.
- `PDF_A_2U`: PDF/A-2u format guarantees that all fonts used in the document are embedded.
- `PDF_A_3A`: PDF/A-3a format for long-term preservation, based on PDF 1.7 Extension Level 3, with full accessibility.
- `PDF_A_3B`: PDF/A-3b format ensures visual integrity for long-term preservation with embedded files.
- `PDF_A_3U`: PDF/A-3u format that includes embedded files and guarantees that all fonts used in the document are embedded.
- `v_1_0`: Adobe PDF version 1.0, the original PDF format.
- `v_1_1`: Adobe PDF version 1.1, introduced in Acrobat 2.
- `v_1_2`: Adobe PDF version 1.2, introduced in Acrobat 3.
- `v_1_3`: Adobe PDF version 1.3, introduced in Acrobat 4.
- `v_1_4`: Adobe PDF version 1.4, introduced in Acrobat 5.
- `v_1_5`: Adobe PDF version 1.5, introduced in Acrobat 6.
- `v_1_6`: Adobe PDF version 1.6, introduced in Acrobat 7.
- `v_1_7`: Adobe PDF version 1.7, introduced in Acrobat 8.
- `v_2_0`: The new version of the PDF standard, PDF 2.0, published by the ISO.
- `PDF_UA_1`: PDF/UA-1 format for universally accessible documents.
- `PDF_X_1A_2001`: PDF/X-1a:2001 format for graphic exchange, based on PDF 1.3.
- `PDF_X_1A`: PDF/X-1a format for graphic arts, ensuring color-managed and reliable printing conditions.
- `PDF_X_3`: PDF/X-3 format, supporting color management for reliable printing outputs.
- `ZUGFeRD`: ZUGFeRD format for electronic invoicing, combining a PDF/A-3 document with XML data.

### `settingspdfsecurity`

The `settingspdfsecurity` is a configuration object nested within the `settingspdf`, providing a set of parameters specifically
for fine-tuning the PDF security process. This property comes into play when the [**actionsecurepdf**](./secure.mdx) flag is set to true,
allowing for detailed control over how encryption, access restrictions, and user privileges are applied to PDFs.

The `settingspdfsecurity` property can contain the following properties:

- <Link to="#cryptoalgorithm">`cryptoalgorithm`</Link> - Encryption algorithm.
- <Link to="#ownerpassword">`ownerpassword`</Link> - Full access password.
- <Link to="#userpassword">`userpassword`</Link> - Password to open PDF.
- <Link to="#usepdf20">`usepdf20`</Link> - Enable PDF 2.0 encryption.

#### `cryptoalgorithm`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>string (default = AESx256)</code>

The `cryptoalgorithm` property specifies the encryption algorithm used to secure PDF documents. This setting comes into play
when the [**actionsecurepdf**](./secure.mdx) flag is set to true, allowing control over the strength and type of encryption applied to the PDF.

Supported values:

- `RC4x40` – 40-bit RC4 encryption, providing basic security suitable for legacy systems.
- `RC4x128` – 128-bit RC4 encryption, offering stronger protection than RC4x40.
- `AESx128` – 128-bit AES encryption, providing modern and secure encryption standards.
- `AESx256` – 256-bit AES encryption, offering the highest level of PDF encryption available in DocumentFactory.

Choosing a stronger encryption algorithm increases document security but may reduce compatibility with older PDF readers.

#### `ownerpassword`

Type: <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>string</code>

The `ownerpassword` property sets the owner password for the PDF document. This password grants full access to the document,
allowing the owner to override any restrictions or privileges defined in the PDF.

This setting comes into play when the [**actionsecurepdf**](./secure.mdx) flag is set to true, ensuring that users
who know the owner password can modify, print, copy, or change security settings regardless of other restrictions.

This property is required. If it is undefined or empty, the Secure PDF process will fail with an error.

#### `userpassword`

Type: <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>string</code>

The `userpassword` property sets the password required to open the PDF document. This password comes into play when the
[**actionsecurepdf**](./secure.mdx) flag is set to true, enforcing access control for users who attempt to open the PDF.

If a user attempts to open the document without the correct `userpassword`, access will be denied, while users who know
the <Link to="#ownerpassword">`ownerpassword`</Link> can still open the document and override any restrictions.

If this property is not defined, the PDF will open in user mode by default without requiring a password.

#### `usepdf20`

Type: <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean (default = false)</code>

The `usepdf20` property specifies whether to enable encryption features introduced with PDF 2.0 (Revision 6, Extension 8).
When set to true, it activates the enhanced encryption mode that supports AES-256. This feature is available only when
targeting PDF v. 1.7 or PDF 2.0.

This setting takes effect only when the [**actionsecurepdf**](./secure.mdx) flag is set to true.

 - If `true`, the document can be encrypted using the modern, stronger AES-256 standard.

 - If `false`, it falls back to the legacy PDF 1.7 encryption model, typically using RC4 or AES-128, ensuring broader
    compatibility with older PDF viewers.

By default, this property is `false`.

#### `documentprivilege`

Type: <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>object</code>

The `documentprivilege` property is a configuration object nested within `settingspdfsecurity` that defines the actions
allowed for users who open a PDF with the user password. This object enables fine-grained control over user permissions,
specifying which operations are permitted on the PDF content.

This property takes effect when the [**actionsecurepdf**](./secure.mdx) flag is set to true and the PDF is secured with `settingspdfsecurity`.

The `documentprivilege` object may include the following properties:

- `allowassembly` (boolean) – Allows users to assemble the document (insert, delete, or rotate pages).
- `allowcopy` (boolean) – Allows users to copy text, images, and other content from the document.
- `allowdegradedprinting` (boolean) – Allows printing of the document in a lower quality (degraded) mode.
- `allowfillin` (boolean) – Allows filling in form fields.
- `allowmodifyannotations` (boolean) – Allows modifying annotations within the PDF.
- `allowmodifycontents` (boolean) – Allows editing or modifying the content of the PDF.
- `allowprint` (boolean) – Allows printing of the document.
- `allowscreenreaders` (boolean) – Enables access for screen reader devices for visually impaired users.

:::note
If a property is not specified, the corresponding action is not allowed by default.

    - **None** (default) – Copying not allowed.
    - **EnableTextAccessForScreenReaderDevicesForTheVisuallyImpaired** – Allows text access for screen readers.
    - **EnableCopyingOfTextImagesAndOtherContent** – Allows copying of text, images, and other content.
- `printallowlevel` – Specifies the level of printing allowed:
    - **None** (default) – Printing not allowed.
    - **LowResolution150Dpi** – Printing allowed at low resolution (150 DPI).
    - **HighResolution** – Printing allowed at full/high resolution.

:::note

PDF security settings (**UserPassword**, **OwnerPassword**, and **DocumentPrivileges**) provide control over document access and user actions.
However, behavior may vary across different PDF viewers:

- **User password**: strictly prevents opening the document without the correct password.

- **Document privileges** (AllowCopy, AllowPrint, etc.) are soft restrictions—enforced only by compliant viewers.
    Some readers (e.g., PDFGear, Chrome/Edge built-in viewers) may ignore them partially or entirely.

- **PDF version / encryption** (UsePdf20, AES-256) may reduce compatibility with older viewers.

Owner password allows overriding all restrictions; these protections are mainly for casual users, not guaranteed security.

**Recommendation**: Always test secured PDFs in target viewers and do not rely solely on privileges for protecting sensitive content.
