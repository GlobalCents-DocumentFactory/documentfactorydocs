# Compress

The `actioncompress` property is a boolean flag used within the processors or postprocess arrays to control whether
the compression process should be applied to documents. This property allows users to enable or disable compression
as part of the document processing workflow.

The `actioncompress` property, when set to `true`, enables the compression of documents within the specified pipeline stage.
Compression is intended to reduce the file size of documents, making them easier to store and share.
This property can be included in either the processors or postprocess arrays, depending on when compression should be applied
during the workflow.
