# Secure PDF

The **Secure PDF** action in DocumentFactory enables encryption and access control for PDF documents. This ensures
sensitive documents are protected, and specific privileges can be restricted or allowed based on user roles. This feature
is particularly useful for organizations that need to secure PDF content before distribution or storage.

## Properties

### `actionsecurepdf`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean</code>

The `actionsecurepdf` setting activates the PDF security feature within the processing pipeline. By setting this property
to `true` within the `processors` or `postprocessors` arrays, the system will automatically apply the specified security
settings to the PDF documents during execution.

Security settings in DocumentFactory allow applying encryption and access control to PDF documents, ensuring that sensitive
content is protected and user privileges are controlled.

The [**settingspdfsecurity**](./pdfsettings#settingspdfsecurity) property inside the [**settingspdf**](./pdfsettings) object
provides detailed configuration for securing PDF files. It enables defining encryption algorithms, passwords, PDF version compatibility,
and specific document privileges, allowing fine-grained control over how PDF security is enforced.

## Example

```json title="pipeline.json"
{
  "processors": [
    {
        "actionsecurepdf": true,
        "settingspdf": {
            "settingspdfsecurity": {
                "ownerpassword": "ownerpassword",
                "userpassword": "userpassword",
                "documentprivilege": {
                    "allowprint":  true
                }
            }
        }
    }
  ]
}
```
In the example above:

- The document is secured using the actionsecurepdf processor.
- An owner password (ownerpassword) is defined, granting full control over the PDF.
- A user password (userpassword) is required to open the document.
- Within documentprivilege, the allowprint option is enabled, allowing users who open the PDF with the user password to print the document.
- All other actions (copying, modifying, filling forms, etc.) are not allowed by default.
