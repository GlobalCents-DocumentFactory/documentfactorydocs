# Split

The **Split** action is designed to break down a document into smaller, manageable parts based on its internal structure.
It is useful when individual sections or elements of a document need to be processed separately — for example,
when splitting reports into per-page files, isolating logical parts of a document, or preparing files for parallel workflows.

This action is supported for the following document types:

- **PDF files** — each page of the original document becomes a separate PDF.
- **Word documents** — splitting is done by document sections, preserving their structure and formatting.
- **Image files** — for multi-frame formats (e.g. TIFF), each frame or page is extracted as a separate image.

## Properties

### `actionsplit`

Type: <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean</code>

The `actionsplit` property is a flag that activates the Split action in the processing pipeline. When set to `true`,
the input document will be automatically divided into separate parts.

This property can be used within the `processors` or `postprocessors` arrays to instruct the system to perform the split
operation as part of the document processing workflow.

## Example

```json title="pipeline.json"
{
  "processors": [
    {
      "actionsplit": true
    }
  ]
}
```
This configuration tells the DocumentFactory to split the document during processing.
