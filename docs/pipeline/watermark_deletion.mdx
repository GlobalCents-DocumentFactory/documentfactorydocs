# Delete Watermark(s)

The Delete Watermark(s) feature in DocumentFactory enables the removal of previously applied watermarks from documents.
This functionality is useful when a document undergoes multiple processing stages, and temporary or staging watermarks
need to be cleared before finalization or distribution.

## Properties

### `actiondeletewatermark`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>boolean</code>

This feature can be enabled in the document processing pipeline by setting the `actiondeletewatermark` property to `true`
within the `processors` or `postprocess` arrays.

### `settingsdeletewatermarks`

*Type:* <code style={{ color: '#0066cc' }}>array of strings</code>

This property defines a list of watermark layer names that should be removed from the document. Each string corresponds
to the [**`layername`**](./watemark#layername) previously used when applying a watermark.

To ensure proper removal, the `layername` must have been explicitly defined during watermark insertion. This allows
the system to identify and remove only the intended watermark layers, without affecting other content in the document.

## Example

```json title="pipeline.json"
{
  "processors": [
    {
      "actiondeletewatermark": true,
      "settingsdeletewatermarks": [
        "watermark_example"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In the example above:

- The `actiondeletewatermark` flag initiates the watermark removal process.

- The `settingsdeletewatermarks` array lists one watermark layer ("watermark_example") to be removed from the document.
