# Naming Pattern

The `namingpattern` property is used to define the pattern for naming documents or files dynamically.
This property is essential for ensuring consistency, uniqueness, and readability in filenames across various
document processing scenarios. Both static and dynamic metadata-based data can be used to build a pattern.

Example:
```json title="pipeline.json"
{
  "metadata": "{\"document_name\":\"Output Document\"}",
  "merge": true,
  "mergesettings": {
    "saveformat": "pdf",
    "namingpattern": "New {{ document_name }}"
  }
}
```

In this example the `namingpattern` property, which is used in the merge process, is set to `New {{ document_name }}`,
and indicates that the output documents will be named using the specified pattern, where "document_name" will be replaced with an appropriate value
specified in `metadata`.
You can find more detailed information about the use of metadata in the section [**Metadata**](docs/pipeline/metadata.mdx).
Adjust the pattern as needed to fit your naming requirements.
