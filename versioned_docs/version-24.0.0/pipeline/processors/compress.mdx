# Compress

The Document Factory enables to optimize document workflows by incorporating compression capabilities.
Compression is a crucial feature that helps reduce the file size of documents, making them more efficient for storage,
transfer, and distribution. This can be particularly beneficial when dealing with a large number of documents or
when document storage space and transfer speeds are a concern.

## `actioncompress`

The `actioncompress` property is a boolean flag used within the `processors` or `postprocess` arrays to control whether
the compression process should be applied to documents. The `actioncompress` property, when set to `true`, enables the
compression of documents within the specified pipeline stage.

Additional properties for the compression process can be specified in the `settingspdfcompression` property of `settingspdf`.
These settings allow for detailed control over how compression is applied, including parameters for image downsampling
and JPEG quality. For more details, see the [**PDF Settings**](docs/pipeline/processors/pdfsettings.mdx) section.

## Example

```json title="pipeline.json"
{
  "processors": [
    {
      "actioncompress": true,
      "settingspdf": {
        "settingspdfcompression": {
          "compress": true,
          "downsample": 150,
          "jpegquality": 50
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
