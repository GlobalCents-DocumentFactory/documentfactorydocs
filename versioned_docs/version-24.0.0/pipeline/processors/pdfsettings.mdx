# PDF Settings

## `settingspdf`

The `settingspdf` property is an auxiliary configuration object used to tailor various PDF generation processes such
as conversion, compression, and more. This property is designed to provide additional settings that enhance and customize
the PDF creation workflow within the Document Factory's document processing pipeline.

The `settingspdf` property can be included within `processors` or `postprocess` arrays to ensure optimal configurations
for distinct PDF-related tasks. Each section where these settings can be applied will include relevant references
and links to the corresponding `settingspdf` properties.

### `settingspdfcompression`

The `settingspdfcompression` property is a configuration object nested within the `settingspdf` property,
providing a set of parameters specifically for fine-tuning the PDF compression process. This property comes into play
when the [**actioncompress**](./compress.mdx) flag is set to `true`, allowing for detailed control
over how compression is applied to PDFs.

The `settingsmergemeta` property can contain the following properties:

- <Link to="#compress">`compress`</Link> - Indicates whether compression should be applied.
- <Link to="#downsample">`downsample`</Link> - Specifies the resolution to which images should be downsampled.
- <Link to="#jpegquality">`jpegquality`</Link> - Determines the quality of JPEG images.

#### `compress`

The compress property determines whether compression should be applied during the PDF generation process.
When set to `true`, the PDF documents will be compressed to reduce file size. Set this property to `false` to disable compression.

#### `downsample`

The `downsample` property specifies the resolution, in dots per inch (DPI), to which images should be downsampled during
the compression process. This integer value sets the image resolution to lower the overall file size of the PDF.
For example, setting this property to 150 will downsample images to 150 DPI.

#### `jpegquality`

The `jpegquality` property sets the quality of JPEG images within the PDF after compression, on a scale from 0 to 100.
This integer value determines the compression quality. Higher values maintain better image quality but result in larger files,
while lower values reduce image quality for smaller file sizes.

### `pdfformat`

The `pdfformat` property is part of the `settingspdf` configuration object. It allows users to specify the desired
PDF format for generated documents, such as during the [**conversion**](./convert.mdx) process,
ensuring the resulting PDF meets specific format requirements.

The value for this property can be a string or null, with the following options:

- `PDF_A_1A`: PDF/A-1a format for long-term preservation, with full compliance for accessibility.
- `PDF_A_1B`: PDF/A-1b format for long-term preservation, ensuring basic conformance without full accessibility.
- `PDF_A_2A`: PDF/A-2a format for long-term preservation, based on PDF 1.7, with full accessibility.
- `PDF_A_2B`: PDF/A-2b format ensures visual integrity for long-term preservation.
- `PDF_A_2U`: PDF/A-2u format guarantees that all fonts used in the document are embedded.
- `PDF_A_3A`: PDF/A-3a format for long-term preservation, based on PDF 1.7 Extension Level 3, with full accessibility.
- `PDF_A_3B`: PDF/A-3b format ensures visual integrity for long-term preservation with embedded files.
- `PDF_A_3U`: PDF/A-3u format that includes embedded files and guarantees that all fonts used in the document are embedded.
- `v_1_0`: Adobe PDF version 1.0, the original PDF format.
- `v_1_1`: Adobe PDF version 1.1, introduced in Acrobat 2.
- `v_1_2`: Adobe PDF version 1.2, introduced in Acrobat 3.
- `v_1_3`: Adobe PDF version 1.3, introduced in Acrobat 4.
- `v_1_4`: Adobe PDF version 1.4, introduced in Acrobat 5.
- `v_1_5`: Adobe PDF version 1.5, introduced in Acrobat 6.
- `v_1_6`: Adobe PDF version 1.6, introduced in Acrobat 7.
- `v_1_7`: Adobe PDF version 1.7, introduced in Acrobat 8.
- `v_2_0`: The new version of the PDF standard, PDF 2.0, published by the ISO.
- `PDF_UA_1`: PDF/UA-1 format for universally accessible documents.
- `PDF_X_1A_2001`: PDF/X-1a:2001 format for graphic exchange, based on PDF 1.3.
- `PDF_X_1A`: PDF/X-1a format for graphic arts, ensuring color-managed and reliable printing conditions.
- `PDF_X_3`: PDF/X-3 format, supporting color management for reliable printing outputs.
- `ZUGFeRD`: ZUGFeRD format for electronic invoicing, combining a PDF/A-3 document with XML data.
